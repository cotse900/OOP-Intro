Workshop 5 reflection
This workshop is on overloading operators to achieve data changes in especially certain arrays in some class where there can be a combination of integers, doubles, and strings. Overall, it is an easy exercise. I spent quite some time on understanding part 1 because like previous workshops there are many instructions. I cannot say the wording is wrong, but it takes effort to understand what it exactly is.
I spent the most time on Flight& Flight::operator=(const int assign) in for the if statement. While I had no issue with the number of passengers, a single && or || kept me from getting an EmptyPlane of 300 passengers instead of an empty plane with 0 passenger, as what the empty state function does.
I also had practice in basic logics in the insertion and extraction operators for adding or subtracting numbers from different arrays. In part 1 it should be about ++ and --, whereas in part 2 you could simply move the figures wholesome since there are few limits on values.
There can be either global functions or friend functions for the binary helper operators, and it is interesting to know casting class reference as integers/doubles. That is probably an important topic later on.
